# ShadowPlay Viewer

Hi, thanks for looking at my application! 
The vision for this application is to be a customizable and characteristic gallery of replays in ShadowPlay, similar to a Plex/Steam library (being able to change the posters/banners).

The reason this is "ShadowPlay" Viewer is because this is specifically designed around how Nvidia's ShadowPlay organizes the folders (each game has its own directory, each with replay files).

Eventually, once that vision is complete, I  would love to be able to implement ffmpeg for compression/conversion, and allow clipping of video files.
